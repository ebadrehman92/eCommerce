I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file. Then I'm able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

Then I enter schema and seed commands. Then a development database is created and is seeded with the data.

Then when I enter the command to invoke the application my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

node seeds (Seed the file)
npm start (Start the server in localhost:3001/)
I then open the API GET routes in Insomnia Core for: (The data for each routes are displayed in a formatted JSON)

categories
products
tags
I then test the API POST, PUT and DELETE routes in Insomnia and able to then create, update and delete data in my database.

Build the back end for an e-commerce site. Take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
Created Schema and Seed data.
GET routes to return all categories, all products.
GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag.
POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories.
